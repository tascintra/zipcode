## 💻 The project

The challenge was to build an application that fetches countries data from an API and shows a countries galery on main page with flags and infos. There is also a country detail page. The challenge also has a dark theme switcher.

Users should be able to:

- See all world countries flags and information
- Search for countries names and filter them by region
- View details page with details about the selected country
- Switch between dark and light theme
- See mouse hover and click effects
- Experience the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
